# Drone Deconfliction System
An AI-powered system that detects and resolves drone flight conflicts in real-time to ensure safe airspace management.With the rise of drone usage, avoiding mid-air collisions has become critical. This project uses AI algorithms to predict and prevent drone flight path conflicts before they happen.


## Features
- Real-time drone path tracking
- AI-based conflict prediction
- Automated route adjustments
- 3D/4D visualization of drone movement
- Support for multiple drones simultaneously

## Project Visualization:-


### No Conflict Visualization

The 4D view (3D space + time) shows three drones ‚Äî PRIMARY (pink), DRONE_1 (yellow), and DRONE_2 (green) ‚Äî flying without any collision risk.  
AI-predicted future positions (yellow circles) align with actual paths, and no red ‚ÄòX‚Äô conflict markers appear.  
The altitude-time graph confirms safe vertical and horizontal separation.  
**Conclusion:** This scenario demonstrates that the AI is accurately predicting drone positions and maintaining safe distances, ensuring smooth and conflict-free flights.

### Conflict Visualization

The 4D view (3D space + time) shows three drones ‚Äî PRIMARY (pink), DRONE_1 (yellow), and DRONE_2 (green) ‚Äî with AI-predicted future positions (yellow circles).  
Here, the AI detects a potential collision point, marked by a red ‚ÄòX‚Äô, indicating where flight paths would intersect.  
The altitude-time graph reveals overlapping trajectories at the same time, confirming the risk.  
**Conclusion:** This scenario shows the AI‚Äôs ability to identify and flag future conflicts in advance, allowing for timely route adjustments to avoid collisions.
