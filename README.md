# Drone Deconfliction System
An AI-powered system that detects and resolves drone flight conflicts in real-time to ensure safe airspace management.With the rise of drone usage, avoiding mid-air collisions has become critical. This project uses AI algorithms to predict and prevent drone flight path conflicts before they happen.


## Features
- Real-time drone path tracking
- AI-based conflict prediction
- Automated route adjustments
- 3D/4D visualization of drone movement
- Support for multiple drones simultaneously


## üìΩÔ∏è Project Demo Video
The visualization shows real-time drone flight paths with color-coded safety status.
